    <h3>
        <p>Hari Raya Aidilfitri, also known as Eid al-Fitr, is one of the most important festivals for Muslims in Malaysia. It marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting from dawn to sunset. Hari Raya Aidilfitri is a time to celebrate faith, gratitude, and forgiveness with family and friends.</p>

    <p>One of the main traditions of Hari Raya Aidilfitri is 'balik kampung', which means returning to one's hometown. Many Malaysians who live and work in urban areas travel back to their ancestral villages or towns to reunite with their relatives. This often causes massive traffic jams on the highways but also creates a festive atmosphere as people exchange greetings and well wishes along the way.</p>
    
    <p>Another tradition of Hari Raya Aidilfitri is giving 'duit Raya', which means money for the celebration. This is usually given by elders to children or younger relatives in green packets as a symbol of blessing and generosity.</p>
    
    <p>A third tradition of Hari Raya Aidilfitri is 'beraya', which means visiting relatives and friends. On the first day of Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Muslims go to the mosque for a special prayer, followed by a visit to the cemetery to pray for their departed loved ones. Then they visit their parents and elders to seek forgiveness and express gratitude. After that, they visit their neighbours, friends, and other relatives to share joy and happiness.</p>
